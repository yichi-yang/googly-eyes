title: Googly Eyes
---

Googly Eyes is a Wear OS watch face featuring two googly eyes as the hour and minute hands. It is goofy, playful, and makes different expression as the two hands (or eyes?) move.
It also supports two complication slots. You can add a "time and date" complication if you want to tell the precise time.

> Definitely not inspired by a certain anime featuring vampires.
